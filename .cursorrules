Phase 1 Considerations:
• Once the execution of ALL processes is finished, all types of significant dynamic
memory, if any, must be released.
• Users' names cannot contain '&'. If they contain them, they must be removed. This
is due to the system's communication protocol, which is in the Annex. This will be
case sensitive.
• Own commands are case insensitive.
• We can consider that the format of the configuration file is correct.
• You cannot use the printf, scanf, gets, puts, etc. functions. You can only interact with
the screen and files with the read and write functions. It is allowed to use the sprintf
function and the like.
• The system, popen or any variant functions cannot be used.
• The stability of the application and its correct functioning must be guaranteed.
Under no circumstances can an infinite loop, core dumpeds, active waits, warnings
when compiling, etc. occur. It is also necessary to control all those aspects that may
cause an error and, if they occur, duly inform the user and, if possible, continue with
the normal operation of the application.
• From now until the end of the practice, it must be considered that the Fleck process
can finish its execution by using the appropriate command or by pressing CTRL+C.
• It is mandatory to use a makefile to generate the executable.
• It is not enough that the file you deliver has a .tar extension, but it must be able to
be unpacked with the tar command. Any practice or checkpoint that cannot be
"decompressed" in this way will not be corrected.
• Remember that the code must be properly modulated, that is: you cannot place
everything in a single .c file, and it is mandatory that there is a makefile. Note that if
when trying to correct a practice it does not compile with the make command (for
whatever reason), the submission will be qualified as unsuitable (2).
• Along with the code, an explanation of how the phase has been designed and
structured must be provided. It is highly recommended that, before starting to
program, you carry out this analysis and validate it with the interns of the subject.
See Appendix IV for more details. The report must include in a clear and
understandable manner:
o Diagrams explaining processes have been created.
o Data structures used and their justification








It is requested:
• That you design and program Fleck.c (name of the program that customers will use).
• That you program Gotham.c, Enigma.c and Harley.c.
• Fleck first processes the configuration file and saves its information in a suitable
structure.
• Fleck will have to recognize the own commands described above. It will only be
necessary to implement the list media / text commands. For the others, show a
message of "Command OK" when it is detected correctly, and "Unknown command"
when there is an error.
• Gotham, Enigma and Harley will have to process the configuration file and save their
information in a suitable structure.
